                        <p>At Samsung Research, our goal is to develop new AI that enriches the
                            customer experience for the billions of users and devices under the
                            Samsung brand. This entails creating AI that is not only aware
                            of how our devices are used but can also anticipate and meet user needs proactively.
                        </p>
                        <p>To achieve this, we have developed and introduced 'The Samsung Gauss
                            generative AI model' at the Samsung AI Forum 2023.
                            Inspired by Carl Friedrich Gauss, a legendary mathematician known for
                            establishing the normal distribution theory crucial to machine
                            learning and AI. Samsung Gauss symbolizes our vision to leverage
                            global phenomena and knowledge. This approach aims to harness
                            AIâ€™s power to significantly improve consumer lives worldwide.
